A cancer cell line: population of cancer cells that originated from a patient's tumor and has been grown in the lab under controlled conditions, so that it can divide indefinitely.
Normal cells cannot divide indefinitely, stops after a few rounds (senescence - related to agining)
cancer cells have mutations that allow them to bypass normallimits on growth
these cells can grow on petri dishes or flasks, in a process known as cell culture

First cancer cell line successfully grown in 1951, the HeLa cells dericed from a cervical cancer tumor from Henrietta Lacks (young African American woman)
at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD
grown by scientist Dr. George Gey
first human cells grown to divide indefinitely, which revolutionized biomedical research
can count number of cells from microscopy image, so after testing a drug, if there's no growth, the drug is working

cell lines are used because they're easy to grow and manipulate in the lab
different cell lines represent various human cancers
serve as models to study tumor genetics, discover cancer vulnerabilities, test therapeutic compounds
used to study molecular mechanism of cancer cells
study signaling pathways in cancer
knockdown or overexpress genes to observe functional changes
investigate the role of oncogenes or tumor suppressors

cancers are heterogeneous diseases (breast cancers have different subtypes)
subtypes defined based on presece/absence of certain receptors and gene expression profiles
main breast cancer subtypes are based on the presence of receptors Luminal A (Estrogen Receptor (ER+), Progesteron Receptor (PR+), HER2-,  best prognosis), Luminal B (ER+, PR+-, HER+-; moderate), HER2+ (ER-, PR-, HER2+), and triple negative (ER-, PR-, HER2-; poor prognosis)

discovery of breast cancer subtypes occured in 2000, group of people working at Stanford (Perou et al), article published in Nature
used microarrays to profile ~65 tumors
identified molecular subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, Basal-like, Normal-like
Introduced the concept of intrinsic subtypes based on gene expression
used 2000 genes in the test

In 2009, Parker et al. published a paper in Journal of Clinical Oncology
refined Perou's gene set to 50 genes (PAM50) for clinical use, hospitals adopted this technique use
classified tumors into the same 5 subtypes using qRT-PCR/NanoString
the subtype can guide the choice of therapy
introduced Risk of Recurrence (ROR) score, based on expression, chance of tumor coming back after surgical removal
led to the clinical test Prosigna, used in ER+/HER2- breast cancer
Prosigna diagnostic assay was developed and commercialized by NanoString Technologies, Inc.
Dr. Charles Perou, now a professor at UNC-Chapel, is the co-inventor of Prosigna

Nanostrings Technologies Inc. is a biotech company founded in 2003, under the leadership of Dr. Leroy Hood.
Technology platforms: nCounter (digital gene expression platform, uses color-code colecular barcodes to directly count RNA, DNA), Prosigna Assay (FDA-cleared diagnostic test for early-stage, hormone recptor-positive breast cancer), DeoMx Digital Spatial Profiler (DSP)
Bruker Corporation (global leader in life-science instrumentation) acquired its assets at $392.6 million (nCounter, GeoMx, CosMx, AtoMx, Prosigna)
Bruker aims to integrate NanoString's gene expression and spatial biology platforms into its broader CellScape proteomics systems

CCLE is a public resource of cancer cell lines developed by the Broad Institute
contains multi-omics data (genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, pharmacologic (how cancer cell lines respond to certain compounds))
used to study cancer biology and predict drug sensitivity
