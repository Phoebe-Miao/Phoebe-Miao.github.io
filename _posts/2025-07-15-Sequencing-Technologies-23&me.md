23andMe is a company that offers genetic testing directly to consumers, providing customers with various reports regarding ancestry and giving information on health predispositions (1). Over time, this biotech company has accumulated the data of 15 million people into one of the world’s largest DNA databases (3).
23andMe was founded by Anne Wojcicki, Linda Avey, and Paul Cusenza in 2006 (2). Avey, a genetics expert, came up with the idea of the company, and Cusenza is an engineer and executive (3). Their initial funding came to about $52.6 million (4). Although, four years ago, the company was worth up to $6 billion, it is now valued at only $74.7 million (3). The total revenue in the fiscal year third quarter in 2025 was $60.3 million (5).
From before 23andMe’s existence, Anne Wojcicki had felt frustrated by how illness was monetized rather than having prevention as the main focus. The company reflected this mindset with the goal of helping people make decisions that lower risk of disease by providing direct access to genetic information (6).
