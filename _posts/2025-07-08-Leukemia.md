  Leukemia is a type of malignant cancer that is characterized by the uncontrolled growth and division of abnormal white blood cells (1). The incidence rate of leukemia among adults is 14.4 per 100,000 population per year (2). Leukemia is idenfitied through blood and bone marrow tests, such as complete blood counts (CBC), blood smears, and bone marrow biopsies. Abnormal blood cell counts, particularly white blood cells, indicate leukemia. Cytometry and molecular pathology are tests used to determine the specific type and subtype (3). 
  Exposure to radiation, breathing in certain chemicals (such as benzene or formaldehyde), history of chemotherapy or radiation therapy, smoking, certain genetic conditions (such as Down Syndrome), and certain inherited blood disorders are factors that can increase a person's risk of developing leukemia. Men are more likely to develop some types of leukemia than women are. Risk may increase with age, depending on the type of leukemia (4, 5, 6). A rare form of leukemia called adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is caused by the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), a retrovirus that infects T-cells, a type of white blood cell (5,7). 
  The specific staging system used depends on the type of leukemia. Leukemia can be classified by acute (fast-growing) or chronic (slow-growing). Acute leukemias (Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)) are described by their progression, while chronic leukemias (Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) may use the Rai or Binet systems (8). Current available treatments for leukemia include chemotherapy, targeted therapy, biological therapy, CAR T-cell therapy, radiation, and stem cell transplant (9). The five-year survival rates for leukemia differ based on the type: CLL is 83.2%, CML is 68.9%, ALL is 68.2% for children and 24.5% for adults, and AML is 27.4% overall and 5.2% for individuals over age 65 (10).
